    /**
     * Output of intr(0.2) is [16.2, 34.4, 5.2]. This is because each
     * element pair (by position) in the array is interpolated.
     * 
     * For ex, for the first element 20 and 1, has the range of 20-1, width a width of 19.
     * Given the domain is 0-1, it can be said for the first element
     * inter(x) = 20-(19 * x)
     * inter(0.2) = 20-(19*0.2)
     * inter(0.2) = 16.2
     * 
     * For the 2nd pair of 40 and 12, has the range 40-12, with a width of 28.
     * Given the domain is 0-1, it can be said that for the first element:
     * inter(x) = 40-(28*x)
     * inter(0.2) = 40-(28*0.2)
     * inter(0.2) = 34.4
     * 
     * The same applies for the 3rd pair of 4 and 10.
